While regular triggers are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events. The event-based trigger framework enables detecting changes made to the data, and automating any subsequent tasks that need to be performed, which are useful in a number of use cases such as implementing a consolidated, central audit table (2379)",
