      "We're excited to announce the Early Access and General Availability of the following powerful new features in YugabyteDB aimed at simplifying operations, enhancing functionality, and improving performance.",
      "YugabyteDB Kubernetes Operator EA",
      "The YugabyteDB Kubernetes Operator is a powerful tool designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators. For more information, refer to the YugabyteDB Kubernetes Operator GitHub project.",
      "Active session history EA",
      "Get real-time and historical views of system activity by sampling session activity in the database. This feature can be used to troubleshoot performance issues effectively. For more information, refer to Active Session History (ASH) documentation.",
      "Instant database cloning EA",
      "Instant database cloning allows you to quickly create independent copies of your database for data recovery, development, and testing. Clones can be created in seconds, and initially consume no additional disk space because they share the same data files as the original database at creation but operate independently after that. Clones can be created as of now or at any time in the recent past (within a configurable history retention period), enabling developers to experiment without impacting production performance. This feature also provides a safety net for rapid recovery from accidental SQL or CQL human errors that cause data loss or corruption.",
      "pg_cron extension GA",
      "The pg_cron extension brings a cron-based job scheduler into the database. With pg_cron, you can schedule YSQL commands using familiar cron syntax, including jobs on intervals as fine as seconds. While pg_cron operates on a single node known as the pg_cron leader, the queries it schedules leverage the full resources of the distributed cluster. On node failure, leadership is automatically transferred, ensuring continuous availability and smooth scheduling operations.",
      "pg_partman extension EA",
      "Use the pg_partman extension to create and manage both time- and serial-based (aka range-based) table partition sets. pg_partman simplifies managing table partitions based on time or serial IDs, automating their creation and maintenance. pg_partman is often used in combination with pg_cron for data lifecycle management, and specifically for managing data aging, retention, and expiration.",
      "Colocated tables with tablespaces EA",
      "Starting this release, you can create colocated tables with tablespaces . With this enhancement, you can now take advantage of colocated tables for geo-distributed use cases, eliminating the need for trade-offs between distributing data across specific regions. You enable the feature using the ysql_enable_colocated_tables_with_tablespaces flag.",
      "Improvement to backward scans EA",
      "The performance of YSQL backward table scans (for example, a descending-sorted query occurs against a table that is sorted ascending) has been improved by up to 10x in this release. You enable the feature using the use_fast_backward_scan flag.",
      "Improved query performance by using shared memory for PG-to-TServer communication GA",
      "This enhancement significantly reduces communication overhead between the PostgreSQL backend and TServer, which plays a critical role in both read and write flows. We observed a 10+% increase in throughput and a 10+% decrease in latency in workloads like TPCC and YCSB. This improvement is particularly impactful in the following scenarios:",

      "New YB-TServer and YB-Master memory allocation settings GA",
      "YugabyteDB uses memory division flags to specify how memory should be divided between different processes (for example, YB-TServer versus YB-Master ) on a YugabyteDB node as well as within processes. New v2024.2.0 universes created using yugabyted or YugabyteDB Anywhere use the recommended memory settings for YSQL (introduced in v2024.1) by default (the --use_memory_defaults_optimized_for_ysql flag is set to true).",
      "Also turned on by default is --enforce_tablet_replica_limits , which enforces tablet replica limits based on the memory allocated to per-tablet overhead across the universe. When turned on, any CREATE TABLE request that would create too many tablets returns an error, and tablet splitting is also blocked if the result would be too many tablets.",
      "In addition, YugabyteDB will alert you if your system currently has too many tablets. If you are upgrading a universe, you may want to review your memory division settings and adjust them if desired; see Best practices .",
      "xCluster support in yugabyted . Adds support for setting up and managing xCluster replication between two clusters deployed using yugabyted.",
      "Semi-automatic xCluster replication . Provides simplified management of YSQL transactional xCluster replication. xCluster management operations are now only required when adding and removing databases from replication. DDL changes can now be made by any database administrator or user with database permissions, and no longer require SSH access or intervention by an IT administrator.",
      "xCluster observability . Improved ability for users to monitor xCluster metrics like Replication Lag, Safetime Lag, and replication errors. EA",
      "Follower reads . Added support for setting yb_read_from_followers=true inside a transaction block using SET LOCAL. This allows greater convenience when setting follower reads for single transactions. You must set yb_read_from_followers before any statement is executed in the block.",
      "Improved query performance . Implemented shared memory for PostgreSQL to TServer communication to minimize latency and enhance query performance by reducing communication overhead. This enhancement is part of Enhanced PostgreSQL compatibility mode .",
      "Precision Time Protocol (PTP) support . PTP is a network protocol designed for highly accurate time synchronization across devices in a network. TP",

      "SELECT query performance. Enables the batching for locking the rows and thus helps improve the performance of the queries which lock more than 1 row using SELECT FOR UPDATE.",
      "Sequential scan speed. Improved ANALYZE and sequential scan performance by leveraging OS-level read-ahead, resulting in up to 8x faster ANALYZE operations.",
      "ALTER support. Added support for miscellaneous ALTER TABLE DDLs.",
      "Catalog caching. Added ability to find catalog tables that can be pre-loaded to improve latency for the first query in a connection, or after a DDL change in the cluster. EA",

      "Azure Cloud integration for Yugabyte Platform (in beta): Yugabyte Platform is natively integrated with Azure cloud to simplify deploying, monitoring, and managing YugabyteDB deployments. This feature automates a number of operations including orchestration of instances, secure deployments, online software upgrades, and scheduled backups, as well as monitoring and alerting. ( 6094 , 6020 )",
      "Yugabyte Platform operations now allow promoting a Yugabyte TServer only node to run YB-Master and YB-TServer process. ( 5831 )",
      "Enhanced multi-region capabilities with geo-partitioning and follower reads The YugabyteDB 2.5 release adds row-level geo-partitioning capabilities as well as follower reads to the extensive set of multi-region features that YugabyteDB already had.",
      "Enterprise-grade security features: Authentication using the highly secure SCRAM-SHA-256 is now supported to limit security risks from brute force attacks and sniffing, including LDAP support for better user management and the ability to audit all database operations.",
      "Table-level partitions This allows users to split what is logically one large table into smaller sub-tables, using the following types of table partitioning schemes that PostgreSQL supports: range partitioning, list partitioning, and hash partitioning. Read more about table partitioning in YugabyteDB.",
      "Event triggers This is now supported in addition to regular table-level triggers in YSQL. While regular triggers are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events. The event-based trigger framework enables detecting changes made to the data, and automating any subsequent tasks that need to be performed, which are useful in a number of use cases such as implementing a consolidated, central audit table (2379)",
      "Simplified cluster administration:",
      "Online rebuild of indexes This is supported for both the YSQL and YCQL APIs. This means that new indexes can be added to tables with pre-existing data while concurrent updates are happening on the cluster. The online index rebuild  process creates the newly added index in the background, and transactionally enables the index once the rebuild of all the data is completed. This feature allows flexibility of adding indexes as the application needs evolve to keep queries efficient.",
      "Cluster execution statistics and running queries This can be analyzed in detail, allowing administrators to gain insights into how the database is performing. The pg_stat_statements extension, which enables tracking execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by the cluster, is supported and enabled by default.  Support for pg_stat_activity has also been added, which shows information related to the activity performed by each connection. Yet another useful feature in this category is the ability to view all the live queries being executed by the cluster at any point in time.",
      "Detailed query plan and execution analysis This can now be performed with commands such as EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE. These commands display the execution plan generated by the planner for a given SQL statement. The execution plan shows details for any SQL statement such as how tables will be scanned (plain sequential scan, index scan), what join algorithms will be used to fetch required rows from the different tables, etc.",
