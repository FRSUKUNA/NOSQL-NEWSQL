Individual queries can override the default language with theCYPHER <version>prefix.As part of this change, version 25 of Cypher is now available including the following changes compared to Cypher 5:Add support for walk semantics (relationships can be repeated) with the newREPEATABLE ELEMENTSmatch mode. Trail semantics (relationships are not repeated) is still the default match mode, and can now also be explicitly specified withMATCH DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS.Add new syntax from GQL for enclosing certain queries in curly braces (either top-level queries or argument queries to a composite query such asUNIONorUNION ALL).Introduction ofWHEN/ELSEbranches which enable the composition of conditional queries, similar to theIFstatement in other programming languages.Introduction of theFILTERclause which allows mid-query filtering with a dedicated standalone clause. This is a GQL conformant clause.Introduction of theLETclause which allows mid-query projection of additional variables with a dedicated standalone clause.

Attempting to create these conflicting graph references now results in a 'Graph reference already exists' exception.Graph reference resolution: In Cypher 25 graph reference resolution has been unified across admin cypher literals, admin cypher parameters, procedures and functions. It is no longer allowed to specify composite and constituent as separate parts (compdb.constituent). Instead, the entire graph reference should be specified as a single symbolic name (compdb.constituent). Whether 'compdb' should be interpreted as a composite or as part of a local alias name is inferred by the existence of a composite with that name.WITHis no longer required as a separator between write and read clauses.UNION [ALL]with different ordering of return items is no longer deprecated.The keywordALLcan now be added after aRETURNandWITHas the explicit form of the clause without duplicate removal.Thereplace()function has been extended with an optionallimitargument.Parameters can now be used inSHORTESTandANYpath patternsIn accordance with GQL, parameters can now begin with extended identifier characters.Subquery expressions no longer use imported variables as grouping variables in aggregations.The character\\u0085(next line) is considered whitespace and not allowed in identifiers.Disallow use of previously deprecated characters in identifiers, see documentation for the full list.Fixed a bug when comparing a node degree expression to a property access.Cypher Shell change the default value of--error-formattogql.This fixes an issue where a hint could not be fulfilled when it was on an OPTIONAL MATCH that was used together with a DISTINCT.fix bug supporting local constituents as a home database",

Credentials for seeding from cloud buckets are now loaded via the cloud providers built-in mechanisms.TheexistingDataoption toCREATE DATABASEis deprecated and has been made optional.An error is now thrown when trying to revoke a privilege that does not exist.Added the optionseedSourceDatabasetoCREATE DATABASE, used to filter the backup artifacts that need to be restored.Administration commands usingWAITwill return the cluster state as notifications instead of as a result.Deprecate theCREATE DATABASEoptionexistingDataSeedInstance. It is replaced by the new optionexistingDataSeedServer.TheindexProvideroption has been removed from the create index and constraint commands.The columnpropertyTypesreturned by the proceduresdb.schema.nodeTypeProperties()anddb.schema.relTypeProperties()previously returned a list of strings representing the potential Java types for a given property. It now returns a list of strings representing the possible Cypher types the given property has.Nodes and relationship are no longer allowed on the right hand side of aSETclause updating properties.String graph references: graph references in graph function arguments containing additional dots apart from the dot separating the composite database and the alias making up a constituent require no quotes of the name part containing dots in Cypher 25, e.g.:USE graph.byName(\"composite.with.dot.constituent\").Ambiguous graph references: Quoting rules for graph references (database names, alias names, composite constituent names) previously allowed to distinguish ambiguous names, for example having a composite constituentcompdb.constituenttogether with a local alias with the namecompdb.constituent. Attempting to create these conflicting graph references now results in a 'Graph reference already exists' exception.Graph reference resolution: In Cypher 25 graph reference resolution has been unified across admin cypher literals, admin cypher parameters, procedures and functions. It is no longer allowed to specify composite and constituent as separate parts (compdb.constituent). Instead, the entire graph reference should be specified as a single symbolic name (compdb.constituent). Whether 'compdb' should be interpreted as a composite or as part of a local alias name is inferred by the existence of a composite with that name.WITHis no longer required as a separator between write and read clauses.UNION [ALL]with different ordering of return items is no longer deprecated.The keywordALLcan now be added after aRETURNandWITHas the explicit form of the clause without duplicate removal.Thereplace()function has been extended with an optionallimitargument.Parameters can now be used inSHORTESTandANYpath patternsIn accordance with GQL, parameters can now begin with extended identifier characters.Subquery expressions no longer use imported variables as grouping variables in aggregations.The character\\u0085(next line) is considered whitespace and not allowed in identifiers.Disallow use of previously deprecated characters in identifiers, see documentation for the full list.",
